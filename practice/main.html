    <h1>Branch</h1>
    <p>
        Branches are used to work separately without disturbing the main branch.
        This allows for fixing errors and adding features without affecting the main branch.
    </p>
    <p>After the work is completed, the branch will be merged into the main branch using a Pull Request.</p>
